    "The Openwater model is, ultimately, a single graph of components and linkages. While, conceptually, the model might be made up of response units, grouped into catchments, which exist in a topology, the graph represents the finest scale model components. That is, the graph doesn't retain any information about the user's conceptualisation of the model.\n",

    "For example, in the semi-lumped catchment recipe, each of the _n_ sub-catchments has m Hydrological Response Units, with using a rainfall runoff models - so rainfall runoff has two dimensions - Subcatchment and Hydrological Response Unit - and is represented as a two dimensional, n x m structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, each of the sub-catchments has p Constituents Generation Units, each of which generations each of the q Constituents using a constituent generation model, so constituent generation has the three dimensions - Subcatchment, Constituent Generation Unit and Constituent."
